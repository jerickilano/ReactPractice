# ReactPractice

## Intro to React

Introduction to the React library and what is it used for, then discover how to design components with React. Identify features that make React powerful, and examine the concepts underlying important React features. 

Also explore the virtual document object model (DOM) and how it is used. Learn how to implement a simple web page by using React web application programming interfaces (APIs); recognize basic components of the web page built using React; and use minified productionized React libraries. 

A two-part tutorial focuses on creating nested elements: creating a DOM hierarchy with nested components, and using key attribute to identify unique sibling elements. Delve into JavaScript XML (JSX) and the functionality of the Babel compiler when used with JSX; then create elements using JSX and the Babel compiler, and render a DOM hierarchy using JSX. Conclude the course by focusing on evaluating simple expressions with JSX, and referring to JavaScript variables within JSX.

# Props and State

Discover how to transfer props from higher to lower-level components using the spread operator; dynamically render components based on conditions with props, and specify default values passed in as props. Next, learn how to validate props and access child elements using props.children; use expressions to pass in props values; and specify functions as children of a component. Next, receive an introduction to State; updating State by using this.setState() in a component; wiring up event handlers to update the state of a component; and accessing a componentâ€™s previous state.
